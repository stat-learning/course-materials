### Two Cultures

#### Reading Questions

1.  What are the two cultures outlined by Breiman?
2.  Is the Ozone Project supervised or unsupervised? Classification or
    Regression? Which methods that we’ve seen could be used to tackle
    this problem?
3.  What is the name of the model/method that is discussed in equation
    \(R\) of section 5.1?
4.  In section 5.4 he states, “If the model has too many parameters,
    then it may overfit the data and give a biased estimate of
    accuracy”. Where would this model be in terms of the bias-variance
    tradeoff?
5.  What is the Rashoman effect? Did you run into this effect is
    question 5 from the last lab?
6.  Explain how one of the techniques that we’ve covered could be seen
    to invoke Occam’s Razor.
